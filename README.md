## SWAPI-Box: Star Wars

#### SWAPI-Box is the first paired project of Mod 3. With this project we were challenged to create a unique user experience that displays select information from the SWAPI-Box star wars API. You can browse through people, planets, and vehicles and favorite any card that you would like to revisit later. There is even a game on the homepage for you to checkout out!

This application was built with create-react-app and the SWAPI-Box API. The learning goals for this project included:
- Writing clean code within organized components, only utilizing class components where necessary.
- Create an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive application.
- Accessing data through the use of the Web-API 'fetch'. Be able to dynamically grab only the information necessary for this application.
- Utilize react-router to create a multi-page application.
- Testing our application with Jest and Enzyme. (Including Asynchronous testing of our fetch calls and Route testing).
- Utilize propTypes to ensure our information was being passed to componenets correctly.
